# myWalk
## Inspiration
There have been times when walking on campus to classes, we came across a really icy sidewalk, and sometimes have to work around it, someone falls and hurts themselves, and wished that we should not have taken that path to class. The ability to help students beware of the sidewalk condition and avoid or be prepaid is going to help a lot of students and this inspired level.
## What it does
It's a web based application, accessible via phone or laptop, shows a map of the campus, with sidewalks safe to walk on, and highlights the side walks icy/snowy to avoid.
## How we built it
We started off by building an Android based application, but realized it will limit the user to only Android platform, and decided to approach a web based application, accessible by most type of mobile devices. We used Google maps api to get the map for the campus of York, used Javascript and HTML5 to create a heat map layer over the regular map to notify the commuter about affected sidewalk

## Challenges we ran into
Loading the heat map on top of the regular map
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
the opportunity to create a project which can not only help York University, but also can be implemented on campuses across Canada.
## What we learned
Google Maps API
## What's next for myWalk
- polish the functionality and the look
- enable early commuters to add information on paths
